# in_class_lab9

To write and test more efficiently I spent time setting up a make file where I can quickly compile and clean code where needed.

$make all  –> this will output two executable files main, and unit_test

$./unit_test  –> will run the code through unit testing

$./main  –> this will run the code through my main function

$make clean  –> this will delete any existing executable files
